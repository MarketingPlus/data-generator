# Data Generator


## Why do this?

As a developer I want a one stop shop to generate data I can use to test my websites capacity while dealing with a large volume of data, add placeholders so clients can understand what the website would look like without having any content to place there, being able to design and style elements regardless of if I can the correct copy writing or images. 


## Deployment

The generator has been deployed at:
